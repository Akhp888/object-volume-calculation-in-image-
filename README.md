# object-volume-calculation-in-image-
Project describes methodology that can be adopted in calculating the approximate volume of any object by means of image reference

# Assumptions made :
1. The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of camera is contant throughtout inference.
2. The 3d points for the object of interest is available either by 3d contour or some detection algorithm.
3. Exact value of reference object dimensions is already available or has provision to calculate.
